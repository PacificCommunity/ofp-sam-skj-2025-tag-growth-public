# Analysis of skipjack tuna growth from tags and otoliths

This public repository contains R scripts and RTMB/TMB models used in the
analysis of skipjack tuna growth from tagging data and otoliths.

The purpose of this repository is to allow anyone to browse and read the code,
for a detailed understanding of the analysis at the technical level.

The original analysis contains sensitive files (Japanese tagging data and SPC
database details) and is therefore organized in a private repository.
